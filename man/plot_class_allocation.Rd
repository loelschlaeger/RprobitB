\title{Plot class allocation (for \code{P_r = 2} only)}
\usage{
plot_class_allocation(beta, z, b, Omega, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{beta}{The matrix of the decider-specific coefficient vectors of dimension
\code{P_r} x \code{N}.
The coefficient vector for decider \code{n} is stored in column \code{n}.}

\item{z}{The vector of the allocation variables of length \code{N}.
Entry \code{n} of \code{z} is an integer from \code{1} to \code{C} and
denotes the allocated class for decider \code{n}.}

\item{b}{The matrix of class means of dimension \code{P_r} x \code{C}.
The mean vector for class \code{c} is stored in column \code{c}.}

\item{Omega}{The matrix of class covariance matrices of dimension \code{P_r^2} x \code{C}.
The covariance matrix for class \code{c} is stored as a vector in column
\code{c}.}

\item{...}{Optional visualization parameters:
\itemize{
\item \code{colors}, a character vector of color specifications,
\item \code{perc}, a numeric between 0 and 1 to draw the \code{perc} percentile
ellipsoids for the underlying Gaussian distributions (\code{perc = 0.95} per default),
\item \code{r}, the current iteration number of the Gibbs sampler to be displayed in the legend,
\item \code{sleep}, the number of seconds to pause after plotting.

\value{
No return value. Draws a plot to the current device.

\description{
This function plots the allocation of decision-maker specific coefficient vectors
\code{beta} given the allocation vector \code{z}, the class means \code{b},
and the class covariance matrices \code{Omega}.
}
\details{
Only applicable in the two-dimensional case, i.e. only if \code{P_r = 2}.
