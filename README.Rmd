The goal of RprobitB is to fit mixed probit models to choice data. 
The package differs from comparable packages in two ways: Bayesian estimation and a focus on taste heterogeneity.

## Installation

You can install the released version of RprobitB from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("RprobitB")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("loelschlaeger/RprobitB")
```

## Documentation

The package is documented in several vignettes:

```r
browseVignettes("RprobitB")
```

## Example

This is a basic example to show how to fit a mixed probit model and make choice predictions:

First, load the package.
```{r load load}
library(RprobitB)
``` 

Then, prepare choice data, for example the Train dataset from the mlogit package. Here, we put 30 percent of data aside for later out-of-sample prediction.
```{r data}
data("Train", package = "mlogit")
data = prepare(form = choice ~ price | 0 | time + comfort + change,
               choice_data = Train,
               re = "price",
               standardize = "all",
               test_prop = 0.3)
```

Call the `mcmc` function to estimate the model.
```{r fit}
model = mcmc(data$train)
```

The summary method gives an overview over the estimation.
```{r summary}
summary(model)
```

Let's visualize the estimated mixture distribution for the price coefficient.
```{r plot}
plot(model, type = "mixture")
```

The `predict` function makes choice predictions and compares the prediction to the actual choices.
```{r prediction}
predict_choices(model, data$test)
```
