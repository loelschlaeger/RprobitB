Welcome to RprobitB!

## For what tasks is this package designed?

With RprobitB[^1] you can 

1. analyze choices made by deciders among a discrete set of alternatives,

2. estimate [(latent class) (mixed) (multinomial) probit models](#levels-of-model-complexity) in a Bayesian framework,

3. model heterogeneity by approximating any underlying mixing distributions through a mixture of normal distributions,

4. identify latent classes of decision makers.

Run `install.packages("RprobitB")` in your R console to install the latest version of RprobitB.

[^1]: The package name RprobitB is a portmanteau, combining **R** (the programming language), **probit** (the model class) and **B** (for Bayes, the estimation method).

Why the notation **(latent class) (mixed) (multinomial) probit model**? Because RprobitB can fit probit models of increasing complexity:

- Most basic, modelling the choice between two alternatives (the **probit model**).

- Considering more than two alternatives leads to the **multinomial probit model**.

- If we incorporate random effects, the model gets the prefix *mixed*.

- The most general model is the **latent class mixed multinomial probit model**, which approximates the mixing distribution through a mixiture of normal distributions.

## A package overview

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(DiagrammeR)
mermaid("
graph TD
    prepare --> RprobitB_data
    simulate --> RprobitB_data
    RprobitB_data --> mcmc
    mcmc --> RprobitB_fit
")
```
