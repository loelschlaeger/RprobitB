\title{Model for multivariate choice between electricity suppliers}
\format{
An object of class \code{RprobitB_fit}.
}
\usage{
data(model_elec)
}
\description{
This object is a fitted mixed probit model to the Electricity dataset of the
{mlogit} package with the model formula
\code{choice ~ pf + cl + loc + wk + tod + seas | 0}.
}
\details{
The model was estimated via
