\title{Update class allocation vector}
\usage{
update_z(s, beta, b, Omega)
}
\arguments{
\item{s}{A \code{numeric} of length \code{C}, the vector of class weights.
For identifiability, the vector must be descending.
By default, \code{s = rep(1,C)/C}.}

\item{beta}{A \code{matrix} of dimension \code{P_r} x \code{N}, the matrix of the
decider-specific coefficient vectors.
The coefficient vector for decider \code{n} is stored in column \code{n}.}

\item{b}{A \code{matrix} of dimension \code{P_r} x \code{C}, the matrix of class
means.
The mean vector for class \code{c} is stored in column \code{c}.}

\item{Omega}{A \code{matrix} of dimension \code{P_r^2} x \code{C}, the matrix of class
covariance matrices.
The covariance matrix for class \code{c} is stored as a vector in column
\code{c}.}
}
\value{
An updated class allocation vector.
}
\description{
This function updates the class allocation vector (independently for all observations)
by drawing from its conditional distribution.
}
\details{
Let \eqn{z = (z_1,\dots,z_N)} denote the class allocation vector of the observations (mixed coefficients) \eqn{\beta = (\beta_1,\dots,\beta_N)}.
Independently for each \eqn{n}, the conditional probability \eqn{\Pr(z_n = c \mid s,\beta_n,b,\Omega)} of having \eqn{\beta_n}
allocated to class \eqn{c} for \eqn{c=1,\dots,C} depends on the class allocation vector \eqn{s}, the class means \eqn{b=(b_c)_c} and the class covariance
matrices \eqn{Omega=(Omega_c)_c} and is proportional to \deqn{s_c \phi(\beta_n \mid b_c,Omega_c).}

\examples{
### class weights for C = 2 classes
s <- rdirichlet(c(1,1))
### coefficient vector for N = 1 decider and P_r = 2 random coefficients
beta <- matrix(c(1,1), ncol = 1)
### class means and covariances
b <- cbind(c(0,0),c(1,1))
Omega <- cbind(c(1,0,0,1),c(1,0,0,1))
### updated class allocation vector
update_z(s = s, beta = beta, b = b, Omega = Omega)
