### data generating process U = Xbeta + eps, beta ~ sum(s * normal), C fix, eps ~ standard_normal


### estimate beta with LCMMNP approach



### estimate beta with Dirichlet approach
## updated class assignments
## update mean and covariance in each class
## draw each beta_c based on class assignment, mean and covariance of class based on Bayes regression formula
