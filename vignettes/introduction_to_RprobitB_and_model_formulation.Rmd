Welcome to **RprobitB**! This vignette introduces the R package and defines the underlying model.

## Introdution

With **RprobitB**[^1] you can 

1. analyze choices made by deciders among a discrete set of alternatives,

2. estimate [(latent class) (mixed) (multinomial) probit models](#levels-of-model-complexity) in a Bayesian framework,

3. model heterogeneity by approximating any underlying mixing distributions through a mixture of normal distributions,

4. identify latent classes of decision makers.

Run `install.packages("RprobitB")` in your R console to install the latest version of **RprobitB**.

[^1]: The package name **RprobitB** is a portmanteau, combining **R** (the programming language), **probit** (the model class) and **B** (for Bayes, the estimation method).

## Levels of model complexity

Why the notation **(latent class) (mixed) (multinomial) probit model**? Because **RprobitB** can fit probit models of increasing complexity:

- Most basic, modelling the choice between two alternatives (the **probit model**).

- Considering more than two alternatives leads to the **multinomial probit model**.

- If we incorporate random effects, the model gets the prefix *mixed*.

- The most general model is the **latent class mixed multinomial probit model**, which approximates the mixing distribution through a mixiture of normal distributions.

## The model 

Assume that we observe the choices of $N$ decision makers which decide between $J$ alternatives at each of $T$ choice occasions.[^2] Specific to each decision maker, alternative and choice occasion, we furthermore observe $P_f+P_r$ choice attributes that we use to explain the choices. The first $P_f$ attributes are connected to fixed coefficients, the other $P_r$ attributes to random coefficients following a joint distribution mixed across decision makers. 

Person $n$'s utility $\tilde{U}_{ntj}$ for alternative $j$ at choice occasion $t$ is modeled as
\begin{equation}
\tilde{U}_{ntj} = \tilde{W}_{ntj}'\alpha + \tilde{X}_{ntj}'\beta_n + \tilde{\epsilon}_{ntj}
\end{equation}

for $n=1,\dots,N$, $t=1,\dots,T$ and $j=1,\dots,J$, where

- $\tilde{W}_{ntj}$ is a vector of $P_f$ characteristics of $j$ as faced by  $n$ at $t$ corresponding to the fixed coefficient vector $\alpha \in {\mathbb R}^{P_f}$,

- $\tilde{X}_{ntj}$ is a vector of $P_r$ characteristics of $j$ as faced by  $n$ at $t$ corresponding to the random, decision maker-specific coefficient vector $\beta_n \in {\mathbb R}^{P_r}$, where $\beta_n$ is distributed according to some $P_r$-variate distribution $g_{P_r}$,

- and $(\tilde{\epsilon}_{nt:}) = (\tilde{\epsilon}_{nt1},\dots,\tilde{\epsilon}_{ntJ})' \sim \text{MVN}_{J} (0,\tilde{\Sigma})$ is the models' error term vector for $n$ at $t$, which in the probit model is assumed to be multivariate normally distributed with zero mean and covariance matrix $\tilde{\Sigma}$.

### Normalization

As is well known, any utility model needs to be normalized with respect to level and scale in order to be identified. Therefore, we consider the transformed model

\begin{equation}
U_{ntj} = W_{ntj}'\alpha + X_{ntj}'\beta_n + \epsilon_{ntj},
\end{equation}

$n=1,\dots,N$, $t=1,\dots,T$ and $j=1,\dots,J-1$, where (choosing $J$ as the reference alternative) $U_{ntj}=\tilde{U}_{ntj} - \tilde{U}_{ntJ}$, $W_{ntj}=\tilde{W}_{ntj}-\tilde{W}_{ntJ}$, $X_{ntj}=\tilde{X}_{ntj}-\tilde{X}_{ntJ}$ and $\epsilon_{ntj}=\tilde{\epsilon}_{ntj}-\tilde{\epsilon}_{ntJ}$, where $(\epsilon_{nt:}) = (\epsilon_{nt1},...,\epsilon_{nt(J-1)})'  \sim \text{MVN}_{J-1} (0,\Sigma)$ and $\Sigma$ denotes a covariance matrix with the top-left element restricted to one.[^3]

### Linking the latent utility to the choices

Let $y_{nt}=j$ denote the event that decision maker $n$ chooses alternative $j$ at choice occasion $t$. Assuming utility maximizing behavior of the decision makers, the decisions are linked to the utilities via
\begin{equation}
y_{nt} = \sum_{j=1}^{J-1} j\cdot 1 \left (U_{ntj}=\max_i U_{nti}>0 \right) + J \cdot 1\left (U_{ntj}<0 ~\text{for all}~j\right), 
\end{equation}
where $1(A)$ equals $1$ if condition $A$ is true and $0$ else.

### Approximating the mixing distribution

We approximate the mixing distribution $g_{P_r}$ for the random coefficients[^4] $\beta=(\beta_n)_{n}$ by a mixture of $P_r$-variate normal densities $\phi_{P_r}$ with mean vectors $b=(b_c)_{c}$ and covariance matrices $\Omega=(\Omega_c)_{c}$ using $C$ components, i.e.
\begin{equation}
\beta_n\mid b,\Omega \sim \sum_{c=1}^{C} s_c \phi_{P_r} (\cdot \mid b_c,\Omega_c),
\end{equation}
where $(s_c)_{c}$ are weights satisfying $0 < s_c\leq 1$ for $c=1,\dots,C$ and $\sum_c s_c=1$. 

### Interpreting the latent classes

One interpretation of the latent class model is obtained by introducing variables $z=(z_n)_n$ allocating each decision maker $n$ to class $c$ with probability $s_c$, i.e.
\begin{equation}
\text{Prob}(z_n=c)=s_c \quad \text{and} \quad \beta_n \mid z,b,\Omega \sim \phi_{P_r}(\cdot \mid b_{z_n},\Omega_{z_n}).
\end{equation}

We call this model the **latent class mixed multinomial probit** model.[^5]

[^2]: For notational simplicity, the number of choice occasions $T$ is assumed to be the same for each decision maker here. However, **RprobitB** allows for a different number of choice occasions for each decision maker.

[^3]: **RprobitB** provides an alternative to fixing an error term variance in order to normalize with respect to scale by fixing an element of $\alpha$.

[^4]: We use the abbreviation $(\beta_n)_n$ as a shortcut to $(\beta_n)_{n =1,...,N}$ the collection of vectors $\beta_n,n=1,...,N$.

[^5]: Note that the model collapses to the (normally) mixed multinomial probit model if $P_r>0$ and $C=1$, to the multinomial probit model if $P_r=0$ and to the basic probit model if additionally $J=2$.
