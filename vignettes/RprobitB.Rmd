Working with `{RprobitB}` follows a structured workflow. The main functions fall into three categories: data management, model fitting, and model evaluation, as illustrated in the flowchart below. A typical workflow proceeds as follows:

1. Prepare a choice data set via the `prepare_data()` function or simulate data via `simulate_choices()`. Both functions return an `RprobitB_data` object that can be fed into the estimation routine. The `train_test()` allows to split the data into an estimation and a validation part. See [the vignette on choice data](https://loelschlaeger.de/RprobitB/articles/v02_choice_data.html) for details.

2. The estimation routine is called `fit_model()` and returns an `RprobitB_fit` object. The `transform_fit()` function allows to change normalization of the model after a model has been fitted. The details are documented in the vignettes [on model fitting](https://loelschlaeger.de/RprobitB/articles/v03_model_fitting.html) and [on modeling heterogeneity](https://loelschlaeger.de/RprobitB/articles/v04_modeling_heterogeneity.html). 

3. The `RprobitB_fit` object can be fed into `coef()` to show the covariate effects on the choices and into `predict()` to compute choice probabilities and forecast choice behavior if choice characteristics would change, see [the vignette on choice prediction](https://loelschlaeger.de/RprobitB/articles/v05_choice_prediction.html). The `classification()` function allows for preference-based decider classification.
   
4. The function `model_selection()` compares arbitrary many competing `RprobitB_fit` objects by computing different model selection criteria, see [the vignette on model selection](https://loelschlaeger.de/RprobitB/articles/v06_model_selection.html).
