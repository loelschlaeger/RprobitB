#'
#' @description
#' This data set includes the binary 'berserking' choice of participants in the
#' yearly bullet arena 2022 on the online chess platform \url{https://lichess.org}.
#' Berserking is a choice each player has at the beginning of each game:
#' When a player clicks the 'Berserk button', they lose half of their clock time,
#' but the win is worth one extra tournament point.
#'
#' @details
#' To 'berserk' is a feature on the online chess platform \url{https://lichess.org}.
#' Before the game starts, each player can click a button, after which
#' they lose half of their clock time, but the win is worth one extra tournament
#' point.
#'
#' The considered tournament had the following characteristics:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item The tournament started at 2022-01-10 17:00:25 and lasted 240 minutes.
#'   \item The time control was 1 minute per player per game (bullet format).
#'   \item The players are automatically and immediately paired again after a game has finished,
#'         which is the so-called 'arena tournament' modus.
#'   \item The players can pause their participation at any time.
#'   \item A win has a base score of 2 points, a draw 1 point, and a loss is worth no points.
#'   \item If a player wins two games consecutively, they will start a double point streak,
#'         which means the following games will continue to be worth double points
#'         until they fail to win a game.
