Description:
    Bayes estimation of probit choice models in cross-sectional and panel 
    settings. The package can analyze binary, multivariate, ordered, and ranked 
    choices, as well as heterogeneity of choice behavior among deciders. The 
    main functionality includes model fitting via Gibbs sampling, tools for 
    convergence  diagnostic, choice data simulation, in-sample and out-of-sample 
    choice prediction, and model selection using information criteria and Bayes 
    factors. The latent class model extension facilitates preference-based 
    decider classification, where the number of latent classes can be inferred 
    via the Dirichlet process or a weight-based updating heuristic. This allows 
    for flexible modeling of choice behavior without the need to impose 
    structural constraints. For a reference on the method, see Oelschlaeger and 
    Bauer (2021) <https://trid.trb.org/view/1759753>.
