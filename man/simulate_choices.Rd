\usage{
simulate_choices(
  form,
  N,
  T = 1,
  J,
  re = NULL,
  alternatives = NULL,
  ordered = FALSE,
  ranked = FALSE,
  base = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{form}{A \code{formula} object that is used to specify the model equation.
The structure is \code{choice ~ A | B | C}, where
\itemize{
\item \code{choice} is the name of the dependent variable (the choices),
\item \code{A} are names of alternative and choice situation specific
covariates with a coefficient that is constant across alternatives,
\item \code{B} are names of choice situation specific covariates with
alternative specific coefficients,
\item and \code{C} are names of alternative and choice situation specific
covariates with alternative specific coefficients.
}

Multiple covariates (of one type) are separated by a \code{+} sign.
By default, alternative specific constants (ASCs) are added to the model.
They can be removed by adding \code{+0} in the second spot.

In the ordered probit model (\code{ordered = TRUE}), the \code{formula}
object has the simple structure \code{choice ~ A}. ASCs are not estimated.}

\item{N}{The number (greater or equal 1) of decision makers.}

\item{T}{The number (greater or equal 1) of choice occasions or a vector of choice
occasions of length \code{N} (i.e. a decision maker specific number).
Per default, \code{T = 1}.}

\item{J}{The number (greater or equal 2) of choice alternatives.}

\item{re}{A character (vector) of covariates of \code{form} with random effects.
If \code{re = NULL} (the default), there are no random effects.
To have random effects for the ASCs, include \code{"ASC"} in \code{re}.}

\item{alternatives}{A character vector with the names of the choice alternatives.
If not specified, the choice set is defined by the observed choices.
If \code{ordered = TRUE}, \code{alternatives} is assumed to be specified with
the alternatives ordered from worst to best.}

\item{ordered}{A boolean, \code{FALSE} per default. If \code{TRUE}, the choice set
\code{alternatives} is assumed to be ordered from worst to best.}

\item{ranked}{TBA}

\item{base}{A character, the name of the base alternative for covariates that are not
alternative specific (i.e. type 2 covariates and ASCs). Ignored and set to
\code{NULL} if the model has no alternative specific covariates (e.g. in the
ordered probit model).
Per default, \code{base} is the last element of \code{alternatives}.}

\item{covariates}{A named list of covariate values. Each element must be a vector of length
equal to the number of choice occasions and named according to a covariate.
Covariates for which no values are supplied are drawn from a standard normal
distribution.}

\item{seed}{Set a seed for the simulation.}

\item{true_parameter}{Optionally specify a named list with true parameter values for \code{alpha},
\code{C}, \code{s}, \code{b}, \code{Omega}, \code{Sigma}, \code{Sigma_full},
\code{beta}, \code{z}, or \code{d} for the simulation.
